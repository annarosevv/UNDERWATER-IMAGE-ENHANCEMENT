# Underwater Image Enhancement

This repository contains an implementation of an underwater image enhancement algorithm. The goal of this project is to enhance the visual quality of images captured in underwater environments, mitigating the challenges associated with underwater imaging such as color distortion, low contrast, and scattering.

## Introduction

Underwater images often suffer from degradation due to the absorption and scattering of light in water. The purpose of this project is to develop an image enhancement algorithm that can effectively address these challenges and improve the overall visual quality of underwater images.

The algorithm utilizes a combination of techniques including color correction, contrast enhancement, and visibility restoration to enhance the underwater images. The proposed approach aims to restore natural colors, improve contrast, and reduce the effects of scattering, resulting in visually pleasing and more informative underwater images.

## Features

- Color correction to mitigate color distortion caused by water absorption.
- Contrast enhancement to improve visibility and enhance image details.
- Visibility restoration to reduce the effects of scattering and improve overall image quality.
- Parameter tuning options to customize the enhancement process based on specific underwater conditions.

## Requirements

- Python 
- OpenCV 
- NumPy 

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/underwater-image-enhancement.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python enhance_image.py --input path/to/input/image.jpg --output path/to/output/image.jpg`

Please refer to the documentation or code comments for more detailed usage instructions and options.

## Results

Sample images showcasing the before-and-after enhancement results are provided in the `results` directory. These images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed underwater image enhancement algorithm in improving the visual quality of underwater images.
